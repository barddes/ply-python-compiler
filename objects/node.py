    Base class example for the AST nodes.

    By default, instances of classes have a dictionary for attribute storage.
    This wastes space for objects having very few instance variables.
    The space consumption can become acute when creating large numbers of instances.

    The default can be overridden by defining __slots__ in a class definition.
    The __slots__ declaration takes a sequence of instance variables and reserves
    just enough space in each instance to hold a value for each variable.
    Space is saved because __dict__ is not created for each instance.
